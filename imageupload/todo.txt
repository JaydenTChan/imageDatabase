TODO by Priority

//Must do by thursday
1. Fix Upload to work properly
	-None of it works correctly
2. Make sure groups work
	-Most of the framework is available
3. Display Module/Search Module

	-May potentially hitch onto the search module
	-Make sure the include the following:
		+Group filter
		+Relevance
4. Make sure display works in conjunction with display and groups
